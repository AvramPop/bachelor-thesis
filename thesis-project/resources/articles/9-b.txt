The history of interpretation of 2 Cor 13:1 has been dominated by a metaphorical con-
strual of the "three witnesses" as Paul's three visits to Corinth. This essay proposes a literal
understanding of the text: Paul invokes the Deuteronomic rule of judicial witnesses in his
own defense, in accordance with the purposes of the statute. The essay then explores the
implications of this interpretation for reconstruction of what happened on the occasion of
Paul's second, "painful" visit to Corinth.
