Behind the statements in James 5:1-6 is an echo of the Gain and Abel story.
While it has been recognized that Abel served as an archetype for righteousness
and unjust suffering, it is sometimes overlooked that Gain fulfilled a similar role.
Beginning with the writings of Josephus and Philo and continuing through to the
Midrashim, Gain was portrayed as an archetype for those who oppress the poor
and the righteous for self-gain. Just as James accuses the wealthy of using dis-
honest means to retain the wages of the poor, so also Gain was accused of increas-
ing his property and possessions through robbery and force. The enigmatic
statements in 5:6 represent an indictment against the wealthy and declaring that
they are guilty of the sin of Gain.
