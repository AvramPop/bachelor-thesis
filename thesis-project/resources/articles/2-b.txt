This paperpresents the circumstances surrounding the publication of the Romanian
translations of C. S. Lewis’s best known works. In the first part, the author gives
information about the Romanian authors who were acquainted with Lewis’s writings
during Communism, when the translation and printing of books on religious topics was
under the tight control of a totalitarian government. In spite of that control, two Lewis
titles—The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Mere Christianity—which were
translated in the US, were smuggled into Romania. The second part of this paper deals
with the remarkably changed situation after the emergence of a new regime in 1990.
Since then Lewis’s books have been published, often in multiple print runs, by secular as
well as Christian publishers, with a total of 12 fiction and 13 non-fiction titles, indicating
a wide popular reception of his work.
