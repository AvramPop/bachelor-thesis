4QInstruction preserves an interpretation of the fifth commandment, to honor ones father
and mother, which has similarities with Philo s comments on it. Because Philo s treatment
of the command plays a pivotal role in assigning influences on instruction to family
members in the New Testament, and the present opinion overwhelmingly views Philo as
indebted to Greek schémas and content, evidence from more recently available Qumran
literature suggests some of the New Testament Haustafeln may have more of a Jewish
intellectual history than is currently acknowledged. This article explores the way biblical
traditions—especially the Decalogue and creation traditions—are used for construing
teachings to members of the family in the 1 Cor 11, Eph 5-6, Philo and 4QInstruction.
