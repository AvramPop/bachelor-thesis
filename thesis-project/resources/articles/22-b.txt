Interpretations of John 19:30 historically have divided themselves into three categories:
(1) Jesus surrenders his spirit in death (traditional view); (2) Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to
disciples at the cross (E.C. Hoskyns); and (3) a combination of these two, wherein the
explicit description of death also implies the Spirit s future denouement. Here a new interÂ­
pretation is offered that is more congruent with Johannine theology and vocabulary: Jesus
is actually returning the Holy Spirit to his Father in preparation for the sending of the
Paraclete as promised in John 7:39.
