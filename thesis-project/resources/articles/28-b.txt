The anonymity of the NT historical books should not be regarded as peculiar to early
Christian literature nor should it be interpreted in the context of Greco-Roman historiog-
raphy. The striking fact that the NT Gospels and Acts do not mention their authors' names
has its literary counterpart in the anonymity of the OT history books, whereas OT ano-
nymity itself is rooted in the literary conventions of the Ancient Near East. Just as in the
OT, where the authors of books that belonged to the genre of wisdom and prophetic lit-
erature were usually named while historical works were written anonymously, only the NT
letters and the Apocalypse were published under their authors' names while the narrative
literature of the NT remained anonymous. The authorial intent of the Gospels' anonymity
can also be deduced from its ancient Near Eastern and OT background. Unlike the Greek
or Roman historian who, among other things, wanted to earn praise and glory for his liter-
ary achievements from both his contemporaries and posterity, the history writer in the
Ancient Near East sought to disappear as much as possible behind the material he pre-
sented and to become its invisible mouthpiece. By adopting the stylistic device of anonym-
ity from OT historiography the Evangelists of the NT implied that they regarded themselves
as comparatively insignificant mediators of a subject matter that deserved the full attention
of the readers. The anonymity of the Gospels is thus rooted in a deep conviction concern-
ing the ultimate priority of their subject matter.
