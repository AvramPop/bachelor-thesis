Eph. 3:19 asks for the Ephesians to "be filled up to all the fullness of God." Several proposals
obtain in current scholarship concerning the nature of the request: for the Ephesians to expe-
rience the fullness of Gods love or being or moral character. However, Jewish Scriptures that
envision Gods sanctuary filled with his glory (Exod. 40; III Kgdms. 8; Ezek. 43), serve as an
important backdrop to this prayer. The primary context of the prayer in 3:14-19, 2:19-22,
viewing the Ephesians as a temple, specific terminology in the prayer (Christ dwelling in
the Ephesians* hearts, being founded in love, the dimensions of Christ's love [referring to
the altar]) and the doxology, which sees God receiving glory in the church, confirm that the
request is for the Ephesians to be filled with God s glory.
