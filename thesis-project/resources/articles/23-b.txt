After reassessing the various ways of dealing with the ellipsis in 1 Tim 2:9, it is argued that
βούλομαι προσεύχεσθαι offers a plausible resolution. Yet the ambiguity of the text suggests
that 1 Tim 2:8-15 resulted from using several sources. The intertextual analysis shows that
1 Timothy very likely used as a pre-text the cultic rule found in 1 Cor 11 and its context. A
second pre-text consists of a station code tradition and of Neo-Pythagorean exhortations.
This complex intertextual enterprise allows 1 Tim to "correct" Paul's more permissive atti­
tude regarding the role men and women can play in public worship.
