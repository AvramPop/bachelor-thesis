This article explores some of the methodological and exegetical issues raised in a recent
Novum Testamentum article by Pier Franco Beatrice, in which a new understanding of the
Judaic gospel tradition in the second century was proposed, based in large part upon
the contention that Ignatius of Antioch displays knowledge of the Gospel of the Hebrews.
The author responds specifically to Beatrice s treatment of Ignatius' writings, as well as
discussing other recent literature on the issue of Ignatius and his sources, arguing that great
caution needs to be displayed in any discussion alleging Ignatius' use of written sources.
