It is widely accepted that the parable of the Pounds (Lk. 19:11-27) is a rewriting of a tradi-
tion also reflected in the parable of the Talents (Matt. 25:14-30), albeit augmented with a
second motif based on the life of Herod Archelaus (4 BCE-6 CE). Yet why would a Chris-
tian redactor choose the ruthless and murderous Judean Ethnarch as a type of the Messiah,
especially so many years after his demise? In this study, we will examine how the archaeo-
logical data may well confirm the Lukan context for this parable, reflecting a very primitive
stage of the tradition.
