This paper argues that the letter to the Hebrews renarrates Israel's history as an extended
exodus which comes to an end as a result of Christ s high priesthood. According to the author,
the promise of rest in Psalm 95 demonstrates that Joshua was unable to lead Israel into God's
promised rest. Based on this exegetical key, the author rereads Israel's history, from Abraham
up until the present day, as an extension of Israels wilderness period. Nonetheless, the letter
encourages its readers by narrating them into this period at the doorstep of the land of rest.
