This article reiterates the argument that contrary to previous proposals five pieces of text-
tual or artefactural evidence (P.Oxy. 2949, P.Oxy. 4009. P. Vindob. G 2325. Ostracon [van
Haelst Nr. 741], and P. Egerton 2) cannot be identified with any certainty as early frag-
ments of the Gospel of Peter or, as in the case of the ostracon, as offering testimony to the
existence of that text. Furthermore, this discussion also responds to the personal attack
made in this journal by Prof. LÃ¼hrmann who took exception with my arguments that the
basis for identifying the fragments as witnesses to the Gospel of Peter was extremely slender
and flimsy. Finally, the discussion states categorically, in opposition to Prof. Liihrmanns
assertion, that I have worked directly with the Oxyrhynchus fragments.
