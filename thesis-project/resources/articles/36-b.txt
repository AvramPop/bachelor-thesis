The Wirkungsgeschichte of Matt. 18:10 presents a more complex picture than so far acknowl­
edged in Biblical and Patristic scholarship. After rehearsing the current scholarly views on
Matt. 18:10, this article discusses the ways in which this verse was interpreted by the Mar-
cosians, by the author of the Ps.-Clementine Homilies, and in various texts by Clement of
Alexandria, Aphrahat, Basil the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. A notable common element
bridging temporal, geographical and ecclesiastical boundaries is the Christological interpre­
tation of the Face (πρόσωπον) in Matt. 18:10, via exegetical identification with χαρακτήρ
in Heb. 1:3 and είκών in Col. 1:15. Almost equally widespread is the interpretation of the
angels in Matt. 18:10 as seven supreme angels, which is carried out via exegetical identification
with the "seven eyes of the Lord" (Zech. 4:10) and the "seven gifts of the Spirit" (Isa. 11:2-3,
LXX). Less common, though also strongly represented, is the use of Matt. 18:10 to illustrate
the intercessory work of the Holy Spirit. While it is certainly true that this verse became a
locus classicus of Christian angelology, and while much of patristic exegesis seized upon the
obvious ethical implications of the passage, the analysis undertaken in this article shows
that Matt. 18:10 also provided scriptural proof for the doctrinal phenomena termed "Face
Christology" and "angelomorphic Pneumatology."
