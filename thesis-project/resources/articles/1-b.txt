The reading of Codex Alexandrinus at 1 John 1:7 (where most MSS read αλλήλων) has not
been clearly or accurately reported in modern critical editions. Some editions suggest there
is some trace of αύτοΰ in the MS and/or that a corrector provided the reading αλλήλων.
That portion of Alexandrinus is damaged and no trace remains of whatever word followed
μετ'/μετα (which is also not fully present) or of a corrector's hand at this point in the MSs.
As the earliest scholars to address this subject indicated, there does not seem to be sufficient
space available for the missing word to have been αλλήλων.
