The meaning of εάν μή in Gal. 2:16 went unquestioned until James Dunn challenged the
traditional understanding of 2:16a, that justification is by faith, not by works of the law.
If εάν μή can only indicate an exception to an entire statement as Dunn assumes, then
Gal. 2:16a must say that people can be justified by works of the law as long as they have
faith, a statement Paul reverses in the latter part of the verse. This essay seeks to supply what
has been missing in the argument for the traditional position: the grammatical proof that
εάν μή does not have to take exception to an entire statement.
