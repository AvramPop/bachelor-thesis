This article investigates how patristic and medieval writers interpret New Testament passages
with the middle/passive διακρίνω. Contemporary NT scholars posit a difference between
NT and classical/Hellenistic Greek meanings and usually justify their choice by means of a
semantic shift. In the texts analyzed for this article, there is litde evidence that Greek patristic
and medieval authors acknowledge a meaning of διακρίνομαι that deviates from the Koine
meaning. If, indeed, a semantic shift took place, they show no awareness ofthat movement.
The transformation of meaning first occurs in translations from Greek to Latin.
