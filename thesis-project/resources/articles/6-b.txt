Five times in the undisputed letters Paul invokes God as guarantor of the truth of a claim
with a form of the phrase "God is witness." Interpreters have long identified these sayings
as self-imprecatory oaths after a pattern attested in the Hebrew Bible. In this article, I
argue that the Pauline phrase "God is witness" is not a self-imprecatory oath at all, but
rather a figure of speech with roots in the rhetoric of classical Greece and a long tradition
in postclassical pagan, Jewish, and Christian literature. In this figure of speech, God is not
testifying against Paul in case Paul should default on a promise; rather God is testifying
for Paul that Paul's character can be trusted.
