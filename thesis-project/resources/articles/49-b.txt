Many scholars have noticed similarities between the Fourth Gospel and the
Qumran pesharim in their approaches to Scripture. However, comparisons between
the two corpora are usually made in passing, often do not offer careful definition
of what constitutes the pesher genre, and tend to isolate certain features for com足
parison. This essay begins from the conviction that it is important to carefully
define the pesher genre before comparing it with the Fourth Gospel. After devel足
oping a definition based primarily on form and content, a broad-based compar足
ison with the Fourth Gospel is carried out, giving attention to some previously
overlooked similarities. In particular, it is demonstrated that John 6:31-58 is per足
haps more pesher-]jke than any other passage in the Fourth Gospel. However, it
is concluded that, while there are impressive similarities between the Fourth
Gospel's exegesis and that of the pesharim, the differences are sufficient that it is
not justifiable to speak of the former as pesher exegesis.
