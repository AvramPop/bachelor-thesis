There has been much discussion and confusion regarding die verb tenses in Revelations
visions, where the author shifts tenses while apparendy retaining the same temporal frame
of reference. This phenomenon of shifting tenses in the Apocalypse has usually been underÂ­
stood to reflect temporal references in relation to the visionary experience of the author, or
more commonly to reflect underlying Semitic influence. However, recent work on verbal
aspect and also the notion of prominence from discourse analysis calls these previous
approaches into question and provides fresh avenues for exploring the authors varied use
of tenses throughout his visions. The array of tense forms utilized throughout the vision in
Revelation 5 can profitably be understood in light of recent work on verbal aspect and
discourse prominence, where the authors shift in tenses function to signal the authors
perspective on the action and the level of importance that the author attaches to various
elements in the vision.
