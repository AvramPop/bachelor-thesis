To analyze some possible foci of a commentators work a model of interpretation is applied:
through Text (the commentary) a Senders/the Interpreter (the commentator) interprets a
Text (the biblical text) to Recipients (the readers of the commentary) as the Message of
Sender 1 (the biblical author) with a certain Purpose to a Recipient (the addressee in the
early church) who is in a given Situation (in the early church).
