This article examines the text of an Arabic Gospel manuscript from the "New Finds" at
St. Catherine s Monastery, Sinai. It provides a general description of the codex, and then
studies two hundred and thirty readings in Saint Lukes Gospel. These readings differ from
the Majority Text and agree with some of the earliest Greek witnesses as well as ancient
versions. The contribution of this manuscript is shown to be considerable, and a warning
against minimizing the textual value of the Arabic versions.
