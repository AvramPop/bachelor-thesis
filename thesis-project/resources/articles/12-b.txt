In elaborating the Jesus tradition ( Q 11:9-10; 6:22-23) James expands, compresses and
elaborates Q sayings in a way which reveals an array of interests in psychagogy and the
care of the soul which we know also to have characterized various strains of Hellenistic
philosophy of the early Roman period. The author of James displays a remarkable interest,
not in such concrete ends as subsistence, debt relief, and the rewards for withstanding per-
secution, but rather in the psychic processes that occur between stimulus and decision and
in the role that proper cognition plays in constructing the subject as perfect.
