This article responds to the recent claim of Josep Rius-Camps that the Pericope Adulterae
was originally composed by Mark. Rius-Camps, in making his creative proposal, has overlooked significant textual and patristic evidence regarding where early Christians confronted the story of Jesus and the adulteress. This evidence suggests that, while the Pencope
Adulterae is not original to the Gospel of John, its first location in fourfold gospel tradition
was its traditional location, John 7:53-8:11.
