In 1 Tim 5, the author turns to the church's financial support of some of its members, and
in chap. 6 discusses individual attitudes toward money and its use. The article concentrates
on chap. 6, especially w . 17-19, and argues that, while philosophical sources are of prime
importance in describing the moral teaching inculcated, popular morality, represented by
clich√©s, proverbs, gnomai, drama, satire and inscriptions, makes possible a thicker descrip-
tion of the moral ecology of the Pastoral Epistles. What emerges is a variety of sometimes
similar teaching relating to wealth. The diversity of viewpoint on the same topics relating
to wealth suggests that it is more realistic to see 1 Tim 6:17-19 as one among other view-
points rather than as derived from one or another of them. What is striking is the promi-
nence given to enjoyment in the proper use of wealth.
