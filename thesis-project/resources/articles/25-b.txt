At the end of 2 Corinthians 5, in which he is defending his style of ministry, Paul appeals
three times to the gospel which he proclaims (w. 14-15, 18-19, 21). These summaries are
worded in ways that indicate the implications of the gospel for his ministry. At the same
time, however, what is true of Paul should be true of all believers: they, too, should be living
for the one who died and was raised for them (v. 15) and passing on the message of recon­
ciliation to others (w. 18-19). In the final summary, Christians are said to "become the
righteousness of God" (v. 21). Käsemanns understanding of δικαιοσύνη Θεοΰ here as a
reference to God's active power of salvation fits the context well: "in Christ", believers
become what he is, and God s righteousness is manifested through them.
