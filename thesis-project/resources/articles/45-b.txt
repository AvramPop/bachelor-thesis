2 Cor. 11:3 at first sight presents us with a simple image, yet the verse can be subject to different
interpretations. Most of the textual variants attested in it are of a stylistic nature, but there is
one which may be of some importance for our understanding of Pauline imagery and its
implications. In ΝΑ 2 7 και της άγνότητος is enclosed within square brackets. Re-examination
of the evidence concerning 2 Cor. 11:3, however, leads to the conclusion that it is much more
plausible that the phrase was a part of the text that Paul wrote. It is therefore not necessary to
enclose it within square brackets or even less so to relegate it to the critical apparatus, as has
been done in some other critical editions of the New Testament.
