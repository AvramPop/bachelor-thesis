In John 21:15 the much-debated expression άγαπας με πλέον τούτων; ought to be inter­
preted "Do you love me more than you love these things?," i.e. all the rest. This conclusion
is strongly supported by compelling arguments concerning grammar (primarily the absence
of συ as a subject and the frequently attested use of πλέον τούτων in the sense of πλέον ή
ταΰτα [accusative]), Johannine, NT and first-century linguistic usage (in John and the
NT nominative personal pronouns are always expressed whenever emphasis lies on them,
even when they are not particularly stressed, and in John the only other occurrence of
πλέον + genitive precisely corresponds to πλέον ή + plural accusative neuter pronoun),
context and sense, ancient versions of this passage (Latin, Coptic, and Syriac), and some
Patristic interpretations.
