This article attempts to locate Rom. 10:5-13 within the tension of orality and lit­
eracy. There has been a debate concerning the precise nature of the relation­
ship between Lev. 18:5 cited in 10:5 and Deut. 30 cited in 10:6-8. Here it is
argued that Paul emphasizes the antithesis between the orality of the Gospel and
the literacy 2 of the Torah because he understands himself as living and working
in the tradition of the "herald" of Isaiah 52. Against the orality of the Gospel
he stresses the literacy of the Torah when he introduces the Leviticus citation
with "Moses writes" in 10:5.
