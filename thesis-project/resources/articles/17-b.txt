Q10 shows some features that equate Jesus' missionaries to Greco-Roman medical practitioners. Moreover, some early Christian texts developed the same imagery, accompanying
it with some hints of social critique. Conversely, under the early empire, the prestige and
the privileges of doctors, who had good patronage connections, were significantly increased
through imperial legislation. The Christian choice of representing missionaries as physicians may be understood by employing the anthropological category of "mimesis". This
entailed a critique of the patronage system and, hence, it arguably won the Christian mission a part of its success in some sectors of the ancient society.
