It is asserted that Matt 26:68|Luke 22:64(|Mark 14:65) is the most difficult of the minor
agreements. Some advocates of the two-source theory have addressed this minor agreement
by trying to make sense of the narrative as we have it, and others by making sense of
the text as we have it (arguing for textual corruption or lost recensions). While some of
these arguments are reasonable, in the final analysis they are not satisfying. Although we
might remain persuaded that the two-source theory best integrates the data relating to the
synoptic problem, this minor agreement reminds us that the synoptic problem is still a
problem.
