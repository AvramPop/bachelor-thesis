This article investigates the lexical meaning of μακροθυμεΐν in Luke 18:7 with a view to
clarifying whether the verb means "to be patient orlongsuffering" or "to delay or tarry".
The former meaning is well-attested in Greek sources, while evidence for the latter is
sparse and is primarily supported by appeal to Sir 35:19 [22], in which μακροθυμεΐν
occurs in parallelism with βραδυνειν. After noting some of the limitations of parallelism
as a lexicographical tool, the article examines the underlying Hebrew text of Sir 35:19.
The verb μακροθυμεΐν is used to render the hithpael of pÛK, a verb which never indicates
a "slowness to act" but rather refers to restraining or controlling oneself. Lexical evidence
that μακροθυμεΐν means "to delay or tarry" is therefore lacking; any sense of a temporal
"delay" in Luke 18 or Sir 35 is to be attributed to the larger literary context and not to the
semantics of the verb itself.
