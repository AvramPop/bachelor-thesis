Paul, in Romans, appears inconsistent in quoting from the Law while declaring believers in
Jesus to be discharged from it. This discussion suggests a resolution, first by comparing
Pauls use of the term νόμος with his appeals to scripture. After observing Pauls tendency
to refer to νόμος as written regulation, not to scripture, the study discusses problem passages to observe Paul using νόμος ambiguously to advance his argument. That sets up Paul's
normative appeal to laws in 13:8-10. Paul appears to advocate reading Torah as instructing
scripture, while declaring its regulatory force at an end in Christ.
