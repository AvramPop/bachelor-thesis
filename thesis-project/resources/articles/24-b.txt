This paper argues that the righteous in Matt 25:31-46 stand out not only by their works of
mercy, but also by their attitudes. Comparable descriptions of judgment emphasize the
self-confidence of the righteous, based on their own knowledge of their good deeds. In
contrast, those acquitted in Matt 25:31-46 are characterized by their ignorance of their
own righteousness and their overall inability to help themselves. The passage therefore
serves as a fitting conclusion to the teaching on discipleship in the Gospel of Matthew,
contrasting the true disciples with the hypocrites (cf. 7:21-23) and bringing together the
twin Matthean emphases on the faith of the helpless and the works of the righteous.
