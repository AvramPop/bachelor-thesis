How should the Johannine expression έκ του θεοΰ γεννάσθαι be translated: as "to be born
of God" or as "to be begotten by God"? The article starts with a look at the translation of
the relevant Johannine passages in Bible translations and biblical studies, to get an idea of
the spread and the influence of the two possible translations. Next, relevant lexical, gram­
matical and exegetical considerations are presented; these lead to the conclusion that the
translation "to be begotten by God" has to be preferred. Finally, some further thoughts on
the Johannine idea of divine begetting are developed.
