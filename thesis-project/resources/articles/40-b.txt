Christopher Stanleys characterization of Pauls original audiences as scripturally ignorant
and his audience-centered approach to Pauls scriptural quotations are without warrant.
The highly conjectural nature of determining original reader competence minimizes the
issues significance and commends an author-oriented approach. Moreover, Stanleys his-
torical methodology is overly minimalistic and inappropriately coupled with arguments
from silence while his analytical method is anachronistically individualistic. Neither the
high cost of Scripture rolls nor illiteracy was likely to prevent access to, or familiarity with,
Scripture in Paul's churches. Stanley does not adequately grapple with the realities of com-
munity dynamics, orality, the centrality of Scripture to early Christianity, or the contextual
character of Paul's Schriftgebrauch. Paul's original audiences are best taken as corporately
learned in the Scriptures and his quotations interpreted accordingly.
