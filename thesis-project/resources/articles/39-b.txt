Interpretations of the resurrection proof in Mark 12:26-27a must explain the relevance of
Jesus' Exod. 3:6 citation and indicate how his conclusion points to resurrection rather than
immortality. Current scholarly proposals often render the proof unconvincing in its logic
and incompatible with / irrelevant to other N T presentations of resurrection. This article
argues instead that Jesus' proof rests on the premise — derived from the Sadducees' example
of marriage — that death annuls a covenant. Since the death of the patriarchs would therefore
have released God from his covenantal obligations, God's faithfulness to those obligations
in the Exodus must imply the patriarchs' continuing existence and e\ T entual resurrection. This
interpretation not only shows Jesus' response to the Sadducees to be a well-reasoned, coherent
whole, it also accords well with the presentation of resurrection elsewhere in the NT.
