The enigmatic phrase in Rev 21:1, "the sea is no more", has yet to be adequately explained
or related cogendy to the rest of the book. In this article I categorise the multiple roles in
which θάλασσα appears in Rev 4-20 and address the potential implications of each use of
sea imagery for explaining its absence from Johns vision of the new heaven and earth.
Along the way, the various theories that have been proposed by other interpreters are
assessed; this is followed by a brief consideration of the potential relevance of several paral­
lels that have been suggested. On the basis of these investigations and an analysis of the
context of Rev 21-22, it is proposed that the difficult phrase in 21:1c is best explained in
terms of the use of a new-creation typology that serves to highlight the way in which this
new creation differs from that described in Gen 1.
