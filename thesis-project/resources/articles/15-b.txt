The frequent occurrence of the term δικαιοσύνη ("righteousness, justice'') in the Sermon
of the Mount (Matt 5-7) (SM) indicates one of the main themes of the text. This impres­
sion is strengthened by the fact that the term is found in strategically important locations
in the composition of the SM. This article does not, however, focus on the meaning and
use of δικαιοσύνη as such. Instead, I discuss the role justice, an important component of
δικαιοσύνη, plays in the SM. To help us gain perspective on how justice was popularly
conceived, a brief survey of one of the most influential ancient analyses of justice, that by
Aristotle in bk. 5 of his Nicomachean Ethics, is provided. Against this background, the way
the notion of justice operates in selected passages of the SM is investigated. I try to show
that the text frequendy manipulates and overturns conventional conceptions of justice and
that this reinforces the SM s demand for a δικαιοσύνη exceeding popular expectations.
