A notable manuscript of Theophylact s commentary on the Gospels, formerly owned by
William Grocyn and Thomas Linacre, has belonged to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, for
470 years. The same volume also contains two leaves from a Gospel lectionary. Long over-
looked by textual critics, this codex has at last attained its place as Greek New Testament
minuscule 2879 and lectionary 2436. In editing the Greek New Testament text from 1514
onwards, Erasmus made considerable use of Theophylact manuscripts at Basle, whereby the
work of Theophylact became a major ingredient in the formation of the Textus Receptus.
There remains a need for a reliable critical edition of Theophylact s commentaries.
