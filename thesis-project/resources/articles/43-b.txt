The phrase την αρχήν in Jn 8:25 is unique in the NT and has caused much debate in inter­
pretation, because in Gr. lit. it usually occurs as (a) "[from] the beginning" and (b) idiom­
atically "to begin with", "at all". The unique reading είπον ύμΐν Papyrus Bodmer II (P 66 )
gives the sense: "I told you from the beginning". However, this reading is probably not origi­
nal, so the pursuit must continue. An investigation into c. 5.000 occurrences in Greek lit.
of all times indicates that here we have a temporal use of the idiomatic adverbial accusative
την αρχήν = "from the beginning". Taking into account the conjunction καί as well as the
position of the expression, Jn 8:25 should be translated:
- "Who are you?"
- "[I am] From the beginning! - precisely what I have been saying (speaking) to you".
