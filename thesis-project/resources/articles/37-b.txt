James D.G. Dunn advocates a well-accepted interpretation model that reads Rom. 7:14-25
and 8:1-17 together solely in terms of Paul's own Christian experience characterized by the
dialectically reframed eschatological tension (i.e., both 'already' and 'not yet' 'at the same
time'). However, Rom. 7:7-25 is not a self-portrait of Paul himself, neither a psychological
description of the mature or non-mature Christian life, but a rhetorical discourse in which
Paul explicates, from his Christian viewpoint, the negative function of the Mosaic Law as
the most delicate issue representing his gospel. Pauline eschatology in Rom. 6, 8, and 7:1-6
puts a decisive weight on the 'already accomplished in Jesus Christ and gives a perspective
that Christians prolepttcally experience in the Spirit liberation from the law, the sin, and the
flesh, confidently anticipating the final victory.
