This article argues that the logic and mode of argumentation of Luke 12:13-34 are illuminated
when one reads the pericope as an elaboration of a chreia, or saying, of Jesus concerning cov-
etousness. Specifically, this passage contains all of the elements—including rationale, con-
trary statement, analog) 7 from nature, historical example, and authoritative judgment—that are
outlined in a progymnastic exercise attributed to the second century C.E. rhetorician Hermo-
genes of Tarsus. Taken together, these elements make up what classical rhetoricians called a
"complete argument.'' This study serves as a complement to the earlier analysis of Luke 12:13-
34 by Abraham J. Malherbe in Novum Testamentum that focused on the topos on greed.
