Did Isaiah 53 (LXX) and its παραδιδόναι-terminology influence the early Christian
notion of Jesus being delivered "for our sins" (Rom 4:25 etc.)? And if so, is that to be
understood as a specific Jewish backdrop for the interpretation of the death of Jesus? The
way in which the Septuagint deviates from the Hebrew text suggests another view. To ren­
der various terms of his Vorlage the translator of the LXX made use of the widespread
Greek notion of delivering somebody unto a hostile force. If early Christian explication of
the death of Jesus drew on Isaiah 53, it was influenced by its Greek translation.
