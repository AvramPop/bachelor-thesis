This essay seeks to bring into focus the methodological presuppositions and the
specific approach of the textual critic and classical scholar GÃ¼nther Zuntz. In his
study, The Text of the Epistles (1953), Zuntz redefined the task of philological
analysis. He insisted that recensio, examinatio, and emendado need to be applied
to the enormously accumulating evidence. Accepting Griesbach's notion of three
large regional sources of New Testament texts, Zuntz criticized Griesbach's assump-
tion that recensional activities, exerted a formative influence upon early regional
texts. He was willing to demonstrate that each source of transmission is capable
of testifying independently.
