The most recent debate of the Synoptic Problem resulted in a dead-lock: The best-established
solutions, the Two-Source-Hypothesis and the Farrer-Goodacre-Theory, are burdened with
a number of apparent weaknesses. On the other hand, the arguments raised against these
theories are cogent. An alternative possibility, that avoids the problems created by either of
them, is the inclusion of the gospel used by Marcion. This gospel is not a redaction of Luke,
but rather precedes Matthew and Luke and, therefore, belongs into the maze of the synop-
tic interrelations. The resulting model avoids the weaknesses of the previous theories and
provides compelling and obvious solutions to the notoriously difficult problems.
