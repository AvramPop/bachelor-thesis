 Rezeptionsgeschichte
 of Zechariah 9:9,surveying a wide variety of Christian authors who span five centuries (JustinMartyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Cyril of Jerusalem, JohnChrysostom, Jerome, Augustine and Caesarius of Arles).

A few important commentators use the text pollemicallyas they wrestle theologically with various categories of opponents (Jews,Ebionites, Valentinians, Marcionites, pagans).
