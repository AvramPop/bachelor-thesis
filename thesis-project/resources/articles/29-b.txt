In Jude 5, the manuscript evidence yields three different subjects [(1) κύριος, (2) Ίησοΰς,
(3) θεός]. The major textual editions, but also the vast majority of English translations,
prefer the κύριος-reading as original. The Ίησοΰς-reading, although acknowledged by
many as lectio difficilior, has generally been regarded as too hard. Yet, in light of the textual
evidence studied from the standpoint of reasoned eclecticism, the traditional preference of
the κύριος-reading appears to be questionable. An examination of both external and inter­
nal evidence suggests that Ίησοΰς should be seriously considered as the original reading in
Jude 5. This would argue for the existence of a high Christology (including Christ's pré-
existence) within the Epistle of Jude.
