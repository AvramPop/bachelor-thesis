Recent approaches to representing the reading of Codex Alexandrinus at
1 John 1:7 in the most important critical apparatuses have been marred by
imprecision and/or simple error. One would not be able to discern the
actual state of affairs from any recent critical edition but would have to go
back to the 1786 facsimile edition of Woide (or a more recent image of the
MS) to have it clearly explained (in Latin). The most recent and authoritative depictions are in fact among the least accurate.
The most recent and thorough reference, the Novum Testamentum Graecum: Editto Critica Maior (ECM), the reading of which was also found on
the New Testament Transcripts Prototype website1
 of the University of
Münster s Institute for New Testament Textual Research until late June
2007, is also the most unreliable at this point. It indicates that while the
original MS evidently supports αύτοΰ, a later corrector indicated the reading
should be αλλήλων (the prototype website indicated this both in the apparatus and in the color-coded transcription of A).2
 Upon being informed of
the error the Institute changed the presentation on the website so that it
now indicates that the word αλλήλων is missing from a damaged portion
of the MS but is presumed to be its original reading.3
 Careful study of the
MS reveals why virtually every previous critical edition has indicated that
the manuscripts reading was unlikely to have been αλλήλων and more
likely to have been αύτοΰ or another alternative significantly shorter than
αλλήλων.
