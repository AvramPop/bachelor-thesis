Recent approaches to representing the reading of Codex Alexandrinus at
1 John 1:7 in the most important critical apparatuses have been marred by
imprecision and/or simple error. One would not be able to discern the
actual state of affairs from any recent critical edition but would have to go
back to the 1786 facsimile edition of Woide (or a more recent image of the
MS) to have it clearly explained (in Latin). The most recent and authoritative depictions are in fact among the least accurate.
The most recent and thorough reference, the Novum Testamentum Graecum: Editto Critica Maior (ECM), the reading of which was also found on
the New Testament Transcripts Prototype website1
 of the University of
Münster s Institute for New Testament Textual Research until late June
2007, is also the most unreliable at this point. It indicates that while the
original MS evidently supports αύτοΰ, a later corrector indicated the reading
should be αλλήλων (the prototype website indicated this both in the apparatus and in the color-coded transcription of A).2
 Upon being informed of
the error the Institute changed the presentation on the website so that it
now indicates that the word αλλήλων is missing from a damaged portion
of the MS but is presumed to be its original reading.3
 Careful study of the
MS reveals why virtually every previous critical edition has indicated that
the manuscripts reading was unlikely to have been αλλήλων and more
likely to have been αύτοΰ or another alternative significantly shorter than
αλλήλων.
Alexandrinus is, in fact, missing the top right-hand corner of the page
where our text appears (that corner of the MS has been lost), and all that
remains of the relevant lines is
It turns out that even the μετ' is cut off in the damaged MS and there is
neither a partial presence of αύτοΰ nor any sign of a later correction to
αλλήλων.4
Close examination of the right-hand margin of the MS suggests that the
available space would have normally been enough for Wi to 5Vi letters (the
following line, with the same amount of space missing, had three more
letters before the margin). The flexibility is due to the fact that the margin
is not perfectly straight and the scribe often wrote in smaller letters to fit
more in as he approached the margin. Even taking those factors (and a
possible line-ending nu) into consideration it is difficult to imagine there
being more than about 5 more letters, at the most, to the line. Since  5
would require space for six more letters and )'would require space
for eight more letters, it is understandable that NA27 thought the spacing was indicative that the former of the two options was more realistic
than the latter. It would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
fit in. This is evidently the reason why the reading explains why
virtually all scholars who touched on the issue6
 have suggested that Alexandrinus must have originally read αύτοΰ (in some cases Alexandrinus
seems to have been the anonymous MS which was mentioned as supporting this reading). This is suggested by Curcellaeus,7
 Mill,8
 Wettstein,9
Woide,10
 Cowper,11
 Griesbach,12
 Tischendorf,13
 Westcott,14
 Vogels,15
 Merk,16
 and all of the Nestle and Nestle-Aland editions.17
 In light of both the textual evidence and the academic consensus that Alexandrinus was unlikely
to have ever had the reading αλλήλων, it is hoped that the Munster Institute might rethink its current approach to describing Alexandrinus's reading as "[αλλήλων]."18
The apparatus of the Editto Critica Maior provides yet another intriguing possibility. It points out that one Old Latin MS reads cum deoP It
identifies it as a "Later text attested in the 5th/6th cent, in Africa, Spain,
Gaul (and Ireland), Italy" and also "readings in the Vulgate tradition."20
 It
turns out that two Latin witnesses have this reading.21
 Codex Perpinianus
(or Perpinianensis),^, is a 13th century Vulgate MS with an Old Latin text
in the Catholic Epistles.22
 The orthography of the Old Latin text demonstrates that it "was copied from a MS not later than the sixth century
before words began to be divided" and it also "has some ancient spellings
found in good MSS of the fourth and fifth centuries."23
 The same reading
is found in Codex Harleianus (z), a 7th-9th century Vulgate MS with an
Old Latin text in parts of Hebrews, 1 Peter, and in the first half of 1 John.24
In light of the reading cum deo in some Latin witnesses, it should be noted
that the reading would fit much better in the space available in Alexandrinus than either. This is not to suggest that
Alexandrinus ever had such a reading, but that such a possibility should be
mentioned wherever the other two possibilities are also mentioned, even if
that reading is only represented elsewhere in a couple Old Latin readings.
The best approach would still seem to be to simply indicate that there is a
lacuna oí approximately 2-5 letters at the relevant point in the MS.
