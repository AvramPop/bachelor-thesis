Several factors contributed to the much slower permeation of C. S. Lewis’s
writings in the Romanian cultural space, as compared with other places: (1)
During the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, Romania’s cultural
model was France (let us not forget that during his youth Emil Cioran desired “a
Romania with China’s population and France’s destiny”); (2) the Communist
regime culturally isolated Romania, diminishing interaction with the Occident to
a minimum; (3) the explicit Christian character of many of C. S. Lewis’s works
would have made them impossible to publish in a country whose leaders were
determined to eradicate “religious mysticism and obscurantism,” as a
precondition for the emergence of the New Man and socialism
Behind the Iron Curtain, Romanians were denied free access to C. S.
Lewis’s works, though, as will be shown in this study, his name was not
completely unknown in Communist Romania. Several intellectuals, e.g. ùtefan
NeniĠescu and Nicolae Steinhardt, who had either travelled or been educated in
the West before 1945 and who had had contact with the Anglo-Saxon milieu,
were familiar with the writings of such authors as G. K. Chesterton and C. S.
Lewis. Later on, in the 1970s and 1980s, some of the few Romanians who had
the opportunity to travel abroad enthusiastically read C. S. Lewis and played an
important part in promoting his writings when the totalitarian system, marked by
restrictions and censorship enforced by severe surveillance, collapsed.
In the present study I endeavour to retrace the main stages C. S. Lewis’s
works went through in entering the Romanian cultural and religious space,
beginning with the period before the fall of Communism, when Lewis’s was
practically an unknown name, further identifying the paths on which his writings
spread in post-communist Romania, and eventually listening to the wider echoes
of his work in the cultural press, in specialized research and (why not?) in the
Romanian blogosphere.
One fact needs to be specified from the very beginning: the author in
question was an active member of the Anglican Church. Of course, Anglicanism
is not a monolithic religious block, not least because its complicated history led
to the emergence of religious subtraditionsʊsome conservative and liturgical
(“high”), some Evangelical (“low”). Without claiming to be an infallible judge
of Lewis’s religious views, I would argue that he was a conservative Anglican.
However, since Lewis never made a point of his confessional identity, he
became compatible with a wide spectrum of religious traditions, from historical
ones (Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism) to the Protestant and Evangelical
(“Neo-Protestant,” to adopt the term used sometimes of Romanian
Evangelicals). Obviously his fiction (The Space Trilogy, The Chronicles of
Narnia) addresses an audience for whom his confessional membership would be
of no interest. As for Lewis’s scholarly works, they largely address specialists
who appreciate above all his extraordinary knowledge and competence in the
area of medieval and renaissance literature.
We could say that Lewis permeated Romanian culture in four different
ways, on four clearly detectable editorial paths. Of course, like every intellectual
construct, the classification I propose is marked by a certain procrustean
artificiality. In order to construct an intelligible (not to say, intelligent) outline,
the explorer will inevitably need to segment reality into categories which are not
always rigidly distinct. The four ways in which Lewis made his entry into
Romanian culture are as follows:
x Lewis, scholarly author known to a restricted circle of
intellectuals;
x Lewis, author of devotional works and Christian apologetics,
promoted by Evangelical publishers (Societatea Misionară Română and
Logos);
x Lewis, classical Christian author, promoted by Humanitas
Publishers;
x Lewis, author of fiction for children (The Chronicles of Narnia),
published by RAO Publishing House.
An observation which should be made from the outset is that, at the
moment, Lewis the scholar is missing from the Romanian book market
altogether. The only translation that gives an inkling of C. S. Lewis’s activity in
the arena of literary criticism is the essay collection titled Of This and Other
Worlds (Despre lumea aceasta úi despre alte lumi, Humanitas, 2011). The book
highlights his interest in literary criticism, but reveals nothing of his special
competence as a medieval and renaissance scholar. To my knowledge, at present
none of Lewis’s scholarly books features in the editorial plans of any Romanian
printing house.
In the above classification, the author of children fiction is listed in the
last position, yet we must emphasize that the earliest stage of Lewis’s
penetration into Romanian culture was represented by the clandestine publishing
of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe during the mid 1970s. The book was
translated and printed abroad and then smuggled into Romania, where it was
spread by underground means. The year when the book was released cannot be
established with certainty, but those who had access to it during the Communist
years testify that it was already available in 1977.
In the following sections we will chronologically present the first three
ways in which Romanian readers became acquainted with C. S. Lewis. I have
deliberately omitted the section dedicated to the other versions of The Lion, the
Witch and the Wardrobe or to The Chronicles of Narnia series published by
RAO Printing House. Those who are interested in this subject should also be
aware of Colin Duriez’s A Field Guide to Narnia, published in Romanian as O
călăuză prin Narnia úi prin întreaga operă a lui C. S. Lewis (Aqua Forte, 2008).
The title of this study announces an analysis of Lewis’s reception in
Post-Communist Romania, but the events that took place after 1990 cannot be
properly explained without referring to the previous period. This is why I am
going to present some information which will help us understand the extent to
which Lewis’s works were known in Romania during the years 1945-1989.
The first Romanian intellectual that is known to have been familiar with some of
Lewis’s books is N. Steinhardt, an Orthodox monk who converted to Christianity
while serving a prison term under Communism. His diary reveals that he visited
London between 1937-1939 and that, during those years, he attended a few
religious meetings of the Oxford Group (Steinhardt 152-53, 220-21, 592-93).
Given that Steinhardt was well acquainted with G. K. Chesterton’s writings, an
author he mentions often, it is no wonder that his Diary of Happiness (Jurnalul
fericirii) contains a reference to The Screwtape Letters. The fragment in question
is inserted below “August 1970.” Accompanied by Dinu Pillat, the author had
paid a visit to the monk Ilie Cleopa, then living at the Sihăstria monastery. A
three-hour talk with the famous Orthodox confessor centred on the two main
types of temptations: the “left-side” temptations (those derived from vices and
passions) and the “right-side” ones (those derived from virtues). Recalling that
discussion, Steinhardt associates the “right-side” temptations with a text from
Screwtape, the senior devil’s letter XXVI to his disciple Wormwood (Steinhardt
272).
I believe C. S. Lewis was also referring to a “right-side” temptation in collection
of diabolic letters. The temptation he mentions is trifling but it opens up colossal
perspectives:
“The guardian devil” of an ordinary Englishman is urging his “patient” to give
up something in a matter that much concerns him: the essentially British matter
of tea. The mortal would like to have his tea at 5 P.M., on the porch. His wife
and his mother-in-law prefer to have it inside. “Give in, the devil whispers, be
humble and kind and unselfish, humour them.” Consequently the man will have
his tea with them, all the while feeling unhappy and wronged, not able to enjoy
his drink, silently cursing both women, who are perfectly aware that they were
granted their desire grudgingly and feel their dislike of him rising. The devil
exults; he has harmed two others besides his own “patient.” (Steinhardt 273).
The text in Steinhardt retains one idea from Lewis’s text, but presents a
simplified version of the complex relational game between the participants
caught in the “Generous Conflict illusion”. In the example given by the
Romanian author, the husband who gives in to the preferences of his wife and
mother-in-law is the victim of the temptation. In Lewis’s imaginary scene, the
conflict gradually degenerates, since it originates in the following causes: (1)
each of the persons involved wishes to sacrifice in order to please the others and
(2) each participant declines to be the beneficiary of what it perceives to be
cheap generosity derived from petty motivations. Old resentments brought to
bear in such a trivial conflict eventually lead to a disastrous situation. The
conflict could have been defused only by an honest exposition of each
participant’s preferences and by keeping within the perimeter of reason and
decency (Lewis, Screwtape Letters 133-134).
The difference in perspective between the Lewisian text and the
interpretation given by Steinhardt seems to indicate that, at the moment when he
was writing his Diary, Steinhardt did not have a fresh reading of The Screwtape
Letters in mind. Besides, this is the only reference to Lewis in The Diary of
Happiness. To what extent Steinhardt was familiar with other writings of Lewis
remains to be determined through the analysis of the former’s complete works.
A more thorough research of the subject should also give due consideration to
the books that are known to have belonged to the Romanian monk (and which
are now part of the library of the Rohia monastery). One would not be surprised
to find that there are other works of C. S. Lewis among the books of N.
Steinhardt.
In the 1970s, the writings of C. S. Lewis caught the attention of another
outstanding Romanian intellectual, Andrei Pleúu, who at the time was a doctoral
student in the history of art. The young scholar studied in Germany between
1975-1977, by way of a Humboldt scholarship, preparing his thesis on landscape
paintings, a work published in 1980 under the title Pitoresc úi melancolie
(Picturesque and Melancholy). The Lewis works studied by Pleúu were
scholarly ones, mainly concerned with the world of the Middle Ages: The
Discarded Image, The Allegory of Love and Studies in Words.
At the end of the ’70s, the aesthetician, poet and art critic ùtefan
NeniĠescu referred A. Pleúu to another important book, Surprised by Joy,
particularly remarkable for Lewis’s description in it of his conversion, first to
theism, and then to Christianity. NeniĠescu (1897-1979), roughly 80 years old at
that time, was a practising Orthodox much concerned with the subject of
conversion and faith in general.2
 A good friend of Nicolae Titulescu and very
active both in the cultural and diplomatic realm, NeniĠescu went to England at
the end of World War II, being entrusted by Iuliu Maniu with the specific task of
informing the British about the Soviet danger. Although he had been warned
about the consequences which the agreement between Churchill and Stalin
would have for Romania, NeniĠescu returned home. Due to the role he played in
the attempt to oust the Groza government, he was arrested in 1949 and
imprisoned until his reprieve, in 1964. NeniĠescu’s visit to Great Britain had
likely facilitated his access to the writings of C. S. Lewis.1
A deeper interaction of A. Pleúu with Lewis’s thinking occurred during
his second sojourn abroad (1982-1983), again as a Humboldt scholar. It was then
that he went through all the books he had access toʊMere Christianity, The
Problem of Pain, Reflections on the Psalms, Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on
Prayer. He found them intelligent, witty, and, most important, transdenominational. Lewis impressed him because of the rigour he put into his
writing. Avoiding doctrinaire positions, Lewis managed to go beyond the narrow
dogmatic confines of any particular denomination and engage believers across
all denominations. The spiritual kinship between Lewis and Chesterton also
played an important role, especially since during his youth Pleúu had taken a
great interest in the latter’s essays.2
 As we will see in another section of this
study, Pleúu’s encounter with the writings of C. S. Lewis was to become
instrumental for their diffusion in post-1989 Romanian society.
In the 1980s listeners to Radio Free Europe were familiar with a broadcast called
“The Intellectual and Religion,” produced by Virgil Nemoianu. He had settled in
the USA in 1975 and is currently a professor of literature and philosophy at the
Catholic University of America, where he has been teaching since 1979. In a
volume containing Nemoianu’s radio broadcast lectures and addresses there is an
article dedicated to C. S. Lewis (Nemoianu 49-51). It is a good general
presentation of Lewis, with an emphasis on his conversion (described in
Surprised by Joy) and his fiction (especially the Narnia novels and the space
trilogy).
The informed reader of the material Nemoianu broadcast will probably
agree with his general view but not with some of the details.3
 For instance, in
connection with Lewis’ transition from atheism to Christianity, one could hardly
agree with Nemoianu that Lewis “experienced a sudden conversion” (Nemoianu
49). On the contrary, Lewis’s conversion happened gradually, first from atheism
to theism, and then from theism to faith in Jesus Christ as Son of God. Between
the two, there was a space of about two years during which Lewis tried to live a
religious life in the absence of hope for a future life.1
 Nemoianu’s assertions that
Surprised by Joy represents “a small study” or “a theoretical work” pose another
problem. In fact, neither the author’s intention, stated in the preface (“The book
aims at telling the story of my conversion” [Lewis, Surprised by Joy, vii]), nor
the actual substance of the book justify the idea that Lewis intended it as a
theoretical work on the topic of conversion.
Nemoianu also writes that “even though C. S. Lewis never expressed his
views on political topics, being content to be a common citizen conforming to
the customs and obeying the laws of his English homeland, we can now infer
[…] that he firmly rejected both Fascism and Communism” (50). In fact, C. S.
Lewis expressed his political views on numerous occasions, and we need not
infer his attitude towards Nazism or Communism by resorting to extraneous
studies, since we are able to quote him directly. The fragment below is typical of
Lewis’s view of Communism:
Detestation for any ethic which worships success is one of my chief reasons for
disagreeing with most communists. In my experience they tend, when all else
fails, to tell me that I ought to forward the revolution because ‘it is bound to
come’. One dissuaded me from my own position on the shockingly irrelevant
ground that if I continued to hold it I should, in good time, be ‘mown down’—
argued, as a cancer might argue if it could talk, that he must be right because he
could kill me (Lewis, Reply 69).
As for the idea of Equality, Lewis spoke often about it. The best known essay on
this theme is probably the one named “Equality” (Lewis, Concerns 17-20).
Tangential references to this issue are also to be found in the essay on
“Membership”:
Equality is for me in the same position as clothes. It is a result of the Fall and the
remedy for it. Any attempt to retrace the steps by which we have arrived at
egalitarianism and to re-introduce the old authorities on the political level is for
me as foolish as it would be to take off our clothes. The Nazi and the Nudist
make the same mistake. But it is the naked body, still there beneath the clothes
of each one of us, which really lives. It is the hierarchical world, still alive and
(very properly) hidden behind a façade of equal citizenship, which is our real
concern (Lewis, “Membership” 19-20).
The relationship between Christianity and politics is briefly discussed by Lewis
in a very penetrating article, called “Meditation on the Third Commandment”
(Lewis, God 196-99). In it he indirectly answers several letters which appeared
in The Guardian calling for a political movement embodied in the form of a
“Christian party.” Fully aware of the inherent difficulties of such an initiative,
especially considering his response to a book by Jacques Maritain, Scholasticism
and Politics, Lewis points out that all parties have at bottom the common goals
of well-being, safety, and a good balance between order and freedom; but that
they differ on the means necessary for attaining them (Lewis, God 196). In order
to illustrate the perplexities and contradictions which would attend the
establishment of a “Christian party,” Lewis envisages the following situation:
three devoted Christians can have three completely different political
orientations. “Philarchus,” a devout Christian, is convinced that well-being can
only come from everyone leading a Christian life, and therefore Christian living
must be imposed on everyone by an authoritarian state, which will remove the
last remnants of the “liberal infection.” In Philarchus’s opinion, Fascism is not
evil in itself but a perverted good, while democracy is a monster whose victory
would mean the defeat of Christianity. Such a character would accept help from
Fascists, convinced that he and his friends are the leaven which could influence
positively the dough of their party. The second character, “Stativus,” is just as
devout a Christian. Adducing the Fall as a premise and being convinced that
men need to have a minimum control over their fellows, but at the same time
determined that God’s demands not be counteracted by Caesar’s, Stativus sees
democracy as the only hope for Christian freedom. Furthermore, he is tempted to
accept help from the defenders of the capitalist status quo, whose commercial
and imperial agenda does not retain even the least appearance of theism. The
third Christian is “Spartacus,” also a sincere Christian, who fervently condemns
wealth, animated by the idea that “the historical Jesus” was betrayed by the
apostles, by the Fathers and the Churches. Starting off from the premise that a
radical change is needed, Spartacus demands a leftist revolution and is willing to
accept help from those on the left who openly declare themselves enemies of
God (Lewis, God 197).
The readers will have realized by now that the three names represent
three different ideologies: Fascism, Conservatism and Communism. How, Lewis
is wondering, could the three characters co-exist in a “Christian party”?
Following in J. Maritain’s footsteps, he proposes a different path: that of civic
responsibility mainly, but not exclusively, expressed in the form of letters to
members of Parliament. Another way would be that of conversion: “He who
converts his neighbour has performed the most practical Christian-political act
of all” (Lewis, God 198).
Lewis’s reflections on the insidious danger of the “humanitarian theory”
of punishment1
 and his essay on pacifism2
 belong as well in the “politics”
category. As for the theme of individual freedom and the relationship between
the state and the individual, we find another memorable passage in “Screwtape
proposes a toast.” Since the following fragment comes from a speech by
Screwtape, a “senior devil,” we cannot avoid the conclusion that for Lewis the
two ideologies highly praised by him are in fact two versions of political
deviltry:
Hidden in the heart of this striving for Liberty there was also a deep hatred of
personal freedom. That invaluable man Rousseau first revealed it. In his perfect
democracy, you remember, only the state religion is permitted, slavery is
restored, and the individual is told that he has really willed (though he didn’t
know it) whatever the Government tells him to do. From that starting point, via
Hegel (another indispensable propagandist on our side), we easily contrived
both the Nazi and the Communist state. Even in England we were pretty
successful. I heard the other day that in that country a man could not, without a
permit, cut down his own tree with his own axe, make it into planks with his
own saw, and use the planks to build a tool shed in his own garden.” (Lewis,
Screwtape Toast 17).
No doubt a much deeper and wider research into Lewis’s works would reveal
even more reflections on political issuesʊsome still very timelyʊand would
strengthen the conviction that Lewis was not content simply to be a law-abiding
citizen of his country. On the contrary, by virtue of his ethical and political
acuity, he often publicly drew attention to the fallacies and delusions which can
accompany the subtle semantic mutations constantly emerging in discourse on
education, freedom, politics, values, and so on.
I mentioned at the beginning of this study that the first book of Lewis’s to be
translated into Romanian was The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The edition
contains no information about the date or place of publication, but the terminus
ad quem is 1977, when one copy arrived in the library of Amfilofie
Liubimirescu, a student at the Baptist Theological Seminary in Bucharest.1
Professor Marius Cruceru from Emanuel Baptist University in Oradea has
confirmed to me that he read this book around 1978 and that, at the time, this
type of Christian literature was carefully concealed by its owners. The available
information implies that the book was translated and distributed by a Romanian
Baptist organization based in the USA.2
 The most striking aspect of this
translation is the Romanization of the characters’ names: Peter, Susan, Edmund
and Lucy became Petru, Suzana, Costel and Lucica, Mrs. Macready became
“doamna Tudor,” and Ivy, Margaret and Betty, the maids, were allotted
Romanian names as well: Leana, Margareta and Veta.
If we were to take an opinion poll among Lewis’s faithful readers and ask them
which is the first Lewis book they would want to see translated into another
language, I suspect that Mere Christianity would get the most votes. Baptist
pastor Iosif ğon, whose criticism of the Communist regime earned him expulsion
from Romania in 1981, made a fundamental contribution to the translation and
printing of this book for Romanian readers. Not long after his arrival in the USA,
Iosif ğon took over the Societatea Misionară Română (Romanian Missionary
Society, Wheaton, Illinois), which was printing and distributing theological
books for Romanians behind the Iron Curtain.
Iosif ğon had been a student at Regent’s Park College in Oxford (1969-
1972), but he only read Mere Christianity later, in the ’80s, while in the United
States. Impressed by Lewis’s perspective on Christianity (“not as a solution to
go to heaven, but as the plan of the Holy Trinity to make people into God’s
image”)3
, he included the book in the editorial program of SMR. The translation
was made by Livius Percy and edited by John Tipei. Iosif ğon recalls that the
title of the book posed some difficulties, and he eventually opted for
Creútinismul redus la esenĠe (Christianity Reduced to its Essence) because he
believed that the author’s purpose was to present the essence of Christianity.4
Before the fall of Communism, SMR was using the services of a Dutch
typographer who agreed to print Christian literature destined to be smuggled
across the Iron Curtain. Such books, printed in runs of about 3,000 copies, did
not usually include all the customary bibliographic information —except for the
printing house and year of publication. This was to protect individuals from
retaliation by the Communist government. Once printed, the books were
distributed to various organizations specializing in the clandestine dissemination
of Christian literature within the Communist bloc.
About 3,000 copies of Creútinismul redus la esenĠe were printed in
1987; it was then reprinted in 1991 and 1994. Ten years were to pass before the
release of a new version, entitled Creútinism, pur úi simplu (Christianity Pure
and Simple, Humanitas, 2004).
A first attempt to translate and publish the famous Screwtape Letters was made
during the Communist period. In 1987, Baptist pastor Paul NegruĠ, a former
colleague of Iosif ğon in pastoral ministry, entrusted Mirela Rădoi, a member of
the Emanuel Baptist Church in Oradea, with the task of translating this book,
which was to be published by SMR. Unfortunately, the manuscript never made it
to the printing press, mainly because the project proved to be more expensive
than estimated (translation rights for such a book cost around $1,000 US).1
 After
Logos Publishers (based in Cluj-Napoca) was established in 1992, its founders,
DănuĠ Mănăstireanu, Adrian Pastor, and Mirela Rădoi (married name, DeLong)
included The Screwtape Letters in their editorial plan. The version prepared for
print before 1989 proved impossible to recover, so the initial handwritten draft of
the translation was carefully reviewed with the help of Marinela Blaj, a
collaborator of the publisher at the time.2
At first the editorial team had in mind several options for translating the
name Screwtape, among which were ScaraoĠchi, Zgândărică or Zgândărel.
Subsequently, Marinela Blaj, who was the book editor, suggested Zgândărilă, a
name whose main advantage was that it evoked such well-known Romanian
characters as Gerilă, Setilă, Flămânzilă, and Ochilă from a famous short story by
Ion Creangă.
 The edition benefited from the talent of graphic artist Marcel
Chirnoagă (1930-2008), who drew the illustrations that accompany the text. An
amusing anecdote recalls the artist’s reaction when Rodica Mocan presented him
with the proposition of collaboration on behalf of the publisher: “Madam, you
have found the right man for the job. I specialize in the diabolic.”1
At that time of great momentum and enthusiasm, Logos printed 10,000
copies of Screwtape, far more than the demand that could be expected from the
Evangelical market. Moreover, readers who had just thrown off the blanket of
Communism could hardly have been expected to appreciate the moral and
theological subtleties implied by the senior devil’s 31 letters to his apprentice.
Not surprisingly, when Screwtape was published by Humanitas in 2003, the
interest in the old Logos version revived significantly.
From the same time (early ’90s) dates the project undertaken by Logos to publish
the Space Trilogy. It was a very ambitious project, and sales of the first volume
(Departe de planeta tăcută, translated by Mirela Rădoi, 1995), of which 5,000
copies were printed, did not meet the expectations of the editors.2
 Despite the
recommendation, on the last page, of “C. S. Lewis, Perelandra, Space Trilogy,
part II”, the second volume never got beyond the project stage, and the series has
never been completed.
The low interest of the Evangelical market for C. S. Lewis’s writings,
the difficulty in finding competent translators, and the obstacles which face
editors interested in purchasing rights to their publication explain why so far
only one Evangelical printing house in Romania has succeeded in publishing
another title of C. S. Lewis.3
 The Hypogrammos printing house made a notable
attempt by purchasing the translation rights for Letters to an American Lady.
However, the financial difficulties they encountered in recent years have left the
project in an uncertain state.
Any analysis of the reception of C. S. Lewis among Romanian
Evangelicals should also consider the dissemination of Lewis’s thinking through
other Protestant or Evangelical authors, such as Alister McGrath4
, Philip
Yancey5
, John Piper6
, Timothy Keller7
 or Sheldon Vanauken8
, as well as J. I.
Packer, D. A. Carson, Rick Warren, Norman Geisler, Carl Henry, Ravi
Zacharias, Lee Strobel, John Ortberg, Josh McDowell and John Stott. Given the
limitations of this study, I have chosen to mention only a few representative
titles, without proposing an exhaustive presentation of the manner in which
Lewis is quoted by these authors.
In recent years the blogosphere has played an important role in the
diffusion of the information on C. S. Lewis among Romanian Evangelicals and
beyond. A thorough survey of the most visited Evangelical blogs would reveal
hundreds of quotations from C. S. Lewis, recurrent references to his works, and
announcements of books by or about him published or about to be published.
After the fall of Communism A. Pleúu had a decisive role in the publishing by
Humanitas of a volume consisting mainly of matter from Lewis’s apologetic
writings. Three titles whose matter appears within that book— Despre minuni,
Cele patru iubiri, and Problema durerii (translated by Sorin Mărculescu and
Vlad Russo) were first published in 1997 in the Terra Lucida collection, and
republished in 2012, with a new cover. In an edition of 6,500 copies, this
“trilogy” remains one of the most popular of C. S. Lewis’s works in Romania.
Two of them, moreover, were published as individual volumes: Despre minuni
(Miracles) was first printed by Top H in 2001 and was later (2007) included in
the ÎnĠelepciune úi credinĠă list along with Problema durerii (The Problem of
Pain).
On the trail blazed by Andrei Pleúu through the first post-Communist
decade, three other important works were soon added to the list of ÎnĠelepciune
úi credinĠă, coordinated by Anca Manolescu: The Screwtape Letters (Sfaturile
unui diavol bătrîn către unul mai tânăr, transl. by Sorana Corneanu, 2003, 2007,
2010), The Abolition of Man (DesfiinĠarea omului, transl. by PetruĠa-Oana
NăiduĠ, 2004), and Mere Christianity (Creútinism, pur úi simplu, transl. by Dan
Rădulescu, 2004). The two-volume anthology edited by Walter Hooper as The
Business of Heaven (1983) has also been translated into Romanian under the title
Treburi cereúti (transl. by Mirela AdăscăliĠei, 2005); but perhaps its Romanian
presence was overshadowed by the more popular titles. The best-seller by far is
The Screwtape Letters (Sfaturile unui diavol bătrân către unul mai tânăr), with
13,000 copies printed during the past ten years.1
Romanian readers could become acquainted with Lewis’s spiritual
journey from the autobiographical Surprised by Joy, published in a Romanian
version in 2008. Having translated Surprised by Joy himself, the author of this
study can attest from experience the difficulties and satisfactions that come from
translating a work of such high intellectual calibre. Although its popularity has
not surpassed that of The Screwtape Letters or the trilogy (Despre minuni, Cele
patru iubiri, Problema durerii), it has been reprinted (2011, 2013; total run:
5,500 copies) and has been reviewed by such critics as Sorin Lavric (“Săgeata
bucuriei,” România Literară nr. 34, September 2010), Daniel Fărcaú (“Surprins
de C. S. Lewis,” August 2009), Corneliu SimuĠ (Oglindanet, 10 February 2010)
and Codrin Liviu CuĠitaru (“DisecĠia unui sentiment,” Dilemateca, October
2013).
For the many readers who have rightly wondered why conversion
occupies such a limited space in a work subtitled “A conversion story,” I wish to
point out that Lewis had presented his intention as clearly as possible in his
subtitle “The Shape of My Early Life” — it is no accident that the recounting of
formative experiences from his childhood and adolescence fills almost half the
book. But since market forces compel publishers to make immediate appeal to as
many potential buyers as possible, a somewhat different subtitle implying an
account of the process of “conversion” was given to the Romanian version.
More recently, Humanitas has enriched its Lewis series with three more
releases: Fern-seed and Elephants (Ferigi úi elefanĠi úi alte eseuri despre
creútinism, transl. by myself, 2011); Reflections on the Psalms (MeditaĠii la
Psalmi, transl. by myself, 2013) and The Great Divorce (Marea despărĠire,
transl. by A. Macovescu, 2013). The book on the Psalms had a run of 2,000
copies, while the other two were produced in 4,000 copies each.
Screwtape, the most popular of C. S. Lewis’s books in Romanian, has
been published both as an audiobook (Sfaturile..., read by Mircea Diaconu,
2008) and as an ebook (2012). Lewis’s autobiographical Surprins de Bucurie,
2012, has also been released as an ebook. The ten titles published between 1997-
2013 (to which Treburi cereúti should be added) justify the conclusion that
Humanitas remains the most important promoter of Lewis’ works in postCommunist Romania.
In post-1989, Lewis and his circle of friends known as The Inklings found an
ardent hermeneut in professor Rodica Albu, faculty member of the Alexandru
Ioan Cuza University of Iaúi.1
 A prime example of her labours was the volume
Inklings. Litera úi spiritul (Iaúi, 2004), which contains excellent introductory
materials about Lewis, Tolkien, Williams and Barfield, as well as significant
excerpts or full works by the authors in question. Votaries of C. S. Lewis will
find between the covers of this book not only a different version of The Abolition
of Man but also fragments from the space trilogy and the Chronicles of Narnia
(viz. The Silver Chair).
Professor Rodica Albu has given Lewis a pre-eminent place in her
research, privileging two of his works: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and
The Abolition of Man. Her reading, in Communist Romania, of the first Narnia
volume effectively turned the book into a powerful parable about a repressive
regime which sought to impose its absolute and unchallenged control on all
spheres of society and even on the mind and consciousness of man itself.1
 Albu
amply demonstrated that books have a life of their own, that they grow richer in
meaning with every careful reader who contributes his own interpretation to the
reception history of that work. Romanian readers will also be interested in
Professor Albu’s notable article about The Abolition of Man, a complex and
profound study perceived by many to be Lewis’ most insightful book on the
dangerous process by which current education helps (perhaps inadvertently)
create “men without chests”.2
The severe ideological and political constraints that encumbered Romania during
the Communist years impeded, but were unable entirely to hinder, the translation
of two of C. S. Lewis’s books, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Leul,
vrăjitoarea úi dulapul) and Mere Christianity (Creútinismul redus la esenĠe).
Since the 1989 revolution, the editorial activities of the Societatea
Misionară Română and Logos Publishers have widened the Romanian reception
of works by and about C. S. Lewis, but not to the extent it had when Lewis was
made a headliner in the list of Humanitas Printing House. The first years’
activities of Logos Publishers suggest that Lewis is too multifaceted an author to
appeal to only a single denominational market, while at the same time his
cultural range and intellectual rigour make him less appealing than might have
been hoped to readers unfamiliar with his kind of theological and philosophical
speculation, or are insensitive to the mythic and symbolic echoes in his fiction.
Now, fifty years after his death, Lewis’s works have permeated a neutral
denominational space and drawn to themselves readers from all theological
traditions. There is reason to believe that, as new titles are added to the Lewis
œuvre in Romanian, his position as a point of reference will become more firmly
recognized, and interest in “the other Lewis” (the author of the space trilogy and
the literary and historical scholar) will increase. New technologies and formats
such as the audiobook and ebook will undoubtedly contribute to enlarging the
circle of readers who will discover with delight the clarity and rigour of his
argumentation, the penetration of his intellect, and the richness of his
imagination.
I cannot conclude this study without drawing the attention of the
Romanian readers to the biography written by Alister McGrath1
 (Andreas Idreos
Professor of Science and Religion at the University of Oxford) and currently
translated into Romanian by Natan Mladin. No doubt, when it is published, it
will be of great interest to Lewis fans in Romania.
